# ID-Net

Example data and demo of ID-Net for 3-D super resolution of microscopy images. 

## Requirements

ID-Net（Isotropic Divide-stages-to-process neural network ）is built with Python and Tensorflow. Technically there are no limits to the operation system to run the code, but Windows system is recommended, on which the software has been tested.
The inference process of the ID-Net can run using the CPU only, but could be inefficiently. A powerful CUDA-enabled GPU device that can speed up the inference is highly recommended.

The inference process has been tested with:

 * Windows 10 pro (version 1903)
 * Python 3.6.7 (64 bit)
 * tensorflow 1.15.0
 * Intel Core i7-5930K CPU @3.50GHz
 * Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti


## Install

1. Install python 3.6 
2. (Optional) If your computer has a CUDA-enabled GPU, install the CUDA and CUDNN of the proper version.
3. Download the ID-Net_Demo.zip and unpack it. The directory tree should be: 
4. Open the terminal in the ID-Net directory, install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. (Optional) If you have had the CUDA environment installed properly, run:

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu=1.15.0
```

The installation takes about 5 minutes in the tested platform. The time could be longer due to the network states.

## Data Generation

### 1. Open the terminal in the ID-Net Demo directory and run code ‘generate_data.py’; the ‘Crop data’ panel will appear..

### 2. Set parameters in ‘Global parameters’

 * HR path: Click the ’Choose’ button, select the raw hr data in your computer. (Full forms of italics are shown in the ‘Abbreviation Table’ of NOTE at the end, and the following also applies. )
 * Patch size: Set ‘Depth’ larger than 1 for sr/denoise net, and then the recommended values for depth, height, width are 32, 32, 32; Set ‘Depth’ equal to 1 for iso net, and then the recommended values for depth, height, width are 1, 32, 32.
 * Threshold: Default value is 0.9. For most data, the default value of 'Threshold' can be selected. However, you can determine the appropriate 'Threshold' according to the preview of the generated training data pair, ensuring that the non signal area of the data is as few as possible and the number of training data pairs is greater than 2K.
 * Gaussian noise: Set the standard deviation of gaussian noise added into lr data. Default value is 0, which means no gaussian noise.
 * Possion noise: Check means to add Poisson noise to lr data. Uncheck means not to add.

### 3. Set parameters in ’3D data parameters’ or ‘ISO parameters’.

#### (1)For sr/denoise network: You need to set parameters in ‘3D data parameters’ to generate processed lr data.
* LR path: Click the ’Choose’ button, select raw lr data in your computer.
* Choose factor: Select the desired improvement factor, which needs to be set as 1 in denoise net and larger than 1 in sr net. 

#### (2)For iso net: You need to set parameters in ‘ISO parameters’ panel to generate synthetic anisotropic data.
* PSF file: Add optical blurring to the generated anisotropic x-y slice. First, you will need to prepare a 2D Gaussian function (.txt file) that can accurately simulate the axial PSF of your 3D datasets. Then click the ‘Choose’ button to load the PSF file in your computer. The program will generate the final synthetic x-y slices with axial resolution similar with that of the z-y slices. These degraded x-y slices with be paired with raw x-y slices for model training. 
* Axis subsample: Resample the isotropic x-y slices of the 3D datasets into anisotropic ones. For example, if you set a value of 2, the x-y slices will be down-sampled by a factor of 2 along x direction. Then the program will generate resampled x-y slices that simulate the anisotropic z-y slices of the 3D datasets.

NOTE: When generating the data for iso-net, which processes a 3D image stack slice by slice, the depth of patch size should be set as 1. In this case, the ‘3D data parameters’ panel will be deactivated by the program. As shown in Fig. 1, only the parameters in the global and iso parameters panels are available (red boxes, Fig. 1). Otherwise, when generating the data for denoising or sr net, which treat a 3D image stack as a whole volume, the depth of patch size should be set greater than 1. In this case, the ‘ISO parameters’ panel will be deactivated (Fig. 2). The datasets for sr or denoising network will be generated.

### 4. Click the ‘Start running’ button. A window showing several data blocks will pop up. The first row is the hr data, and the second row is generated low-resolution or anisotropic data, which can be used to judge whether or not the simulated data is correct.

</div>

NOTE: Only when patch_size’s depth value is equal to 1 will the isotropic data be generated, then the parameter setting of ‘3D data parameters’ will be ignored by the system. As is shown in figure 1 below, only the parameters in the box will be used; when the depth value of patch_size is greater than 1, the data of sr/denoise network will be generated, then the parameter setting of ‘ISO parameters’ will be ignored by the system. As is shown in figure 2 below, only the parameters in the box will be used.

## Training Process

### 1. We can start training models after the training pairs have been properly generated. To run the training procedure, open the terminal in the ID-Net Demo directory and run “python train.py ”, the following ‘Training GUI’ panel will pop up.

<div align=center>
<img width="480" height="360" src="/sample/fig/fig7.png"/>
</div>

### 2. Set the parameters. 

 * Choose data type: Select which type of organelle your data belong to.
 * Choose net type: Select the specific type of augment to be trained: superresolution, denoising or iso enhancement.
 * Choose factor: Select the enhancement factor, which should match the setting made at the data generation step.
 * Choose loss function: Select appropriate loss function, ‘mae’ or ‘mse’, for the model training.
 * LPIPS loss: Choose whether LPIPS perceptual loss is required during the training. 
 * Label tag: Add specific tag to the currently trained network.
 * Patch size: Set its values according to the 'patch size' of ‘Global parameters' in ‘Crop data’ panel.

### 3. Click the ‘Start running’ button to start the training procedure.

## Inference Process

### Due to the limitation of data size, the pre-trained models are stored [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gyQIg25Jn1duvEGEXZRmQ0oogb2f4Mfh/view?usp=sharing), You will need to download it and unzip it to the checkpoint folder of the original ID-Net demo. The example data of various organelles used to test the model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LqPX_0bGku-fwAqy1HG5pxdgp5E-Xupr/view?usp=sharing).Please note that if you want to restore the confocal or light slice microscope data collected by yourself, please resample your raw data according to the [pixel size](/sample/fig/pixesize.xlsx) of the corresponding subcellular structures. 

### 1. Open the terminal in the ID-Net Demo directory and run the code ’eval.py’, the following ‘Validation’ panel will pop up.

### 2. Set parameter ‘data type’: Select the type of organelle to be reconstructed.

### 3. The ID is a multi-stage progressive restoration model containing three sub models as denoising, superresolution, and isotropic restoration. If you trained all three models, you can fun full ID restoration with checking all the three boxes at the bottom of the panel. Otherwise, you can check the specific type (s) of restoration model (s) you have trained to enhance the raw data. For example, if you only trained the denoising and supe-resolution models, then check ‘Denoise’ and ‘SR’ boxes to allow the trained models to infer denoised-and-super-resolved images.

</div>

### 4. You can set thresholds for the selected models separately. This will allow you to slightly tune the visual effect of the model outputs. It’s noted that the default network label tags are “lightsheet” and “confocal” in our program, and "confocal" label is only used to convert "confocal" data to “lightsheet” data

 * Normalize_threshold: The normalization threshold of the validation data. The default value of 99.99 is recommended.
 * ISO z sub factor: The magnification of the axial interpolation set for matching the pixel size in isotropic outputs.
 * Validation_data_path：Click the ’Choose’ button to select the validation data that have been downloaded in your computer.

### 5. Click ‘Strat running’ button to start the inference. The model outputs will be saved at newly created subfolder of the “Validation_data_path”.
